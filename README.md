## Why it's Interesting

Although this article is a few years old, I think this topic is really intersting for its practical applications in the future. I have always found brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) really interesting, as I believe they are the eventual future of personal devices in a sense. As the article says, BCIs are advancing rapidly and more companies are experimenting with them for practical applications like creating a neuroprosthesis or other means of rehabilitation. These interfaces could give people with disabilities the means to communicate more effectively or even move more effectively. Elon Musk's Neuralink company is an example of what is most likely the future for personal devices. Not only are BCIs useful for medical applications, they could allow for deeply immersive experiences through simulations that are similar to dreams with the vivedness of reality. People could experience movies, shows, sceneries, and more in a highly realistic display with BCIs. Although this is a somewhat scary concept, the same could be said for emerging technologies decades ago. Although this technology is certainly still emerging and developing with a long way to go before possible wide-spread adoption, but it's defintely something worth thinking about for the future.
